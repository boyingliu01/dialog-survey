## Quickstart

```bash
# One-line install — interactive prompts for each value
npx dialog-survey install

# Start the service
npx dialog-survey start

# That's it. Your dialog bot is live on DingTalk.
```

**Prerequisites:** Node.js >= 20, PostgreSQL 14+, a DingTalk application (Client ID/Secret/Agent ID).

## Why — 为什么做这个项目？

**One-on-one interviews are great.** People enjoy real conversations — a skilled interviewer builds rapport, reads between the lines, and asks exactly the right follow-up. But interviewing hundreds or thousands of people is expensive and doesn't scale.

**Surveys scale beautifully**, but they're shallow. A fixed questionnaire can't pivot when a respondent says something unexpected.

Dialog Survey fills the gap between these two. It's **deeper than a form, broader than a human.** An AI-powered dialog bot probes interesting responses like a human would, while reaching hundreds of participants in parallel via DingTalk. It won't replace a great interviewer — but when you need structured, first-hand insights from a large group, it's the closest thing without hiring an army of researchers.

## What — 这个项目是什么？

Dialog Survey is an **async survey dialog bot** that lives inside DingTalk. You design a survey template, invite participants, and the AI conducts a multi-turn conversation with each person — asking initial questions, probing deeper on interesting answers, and remembering context across days and messages.

### Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **AI-driven follow-ups** | LLM-powered intelligent probing — when a participant says something interesting, the bot digs deeper automatically |
| **Multi-turn context memory** | Coherent conversations that span days and multiple messages, not isolated Q&A rounds |
| **Async messaging** | Participants answer in their spare time on DingTalk — no scheduled calls, no pressure |
| **Auto report generation** | Markdown reports generated automatically after interviews complete — PDF/Excel export via Playwright |
| **Self-hosted** | All data stays on your infrastructure. PostgreSQL, your LLM (ollama / vLLM / cloud), your DingTalk app |

### What's New (v1.8.x)

- **v1.8.1** — Full project doc refresh: compressed AGENTS.md to 88 lines, added subdirectory AGENTS.md for repositories/integrations/utils
- **v1.8.0** — Removed unused ASR/voice recognition. Fixed COMPLETED dialogs stuck in CONTINUE loop. Fixed maxFollowups not persisted to DB. Fixed add-member modal swallowing errors silently.
- **v1.7.9** — CI stability: fixed flaky integration tests, cleaned up secrets from sample configs
- **v1.7.8** — Unified tsconfig.json, fixed 81 type errors across 35 files

> Full changelog in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

## How — 怎么使用这个项目？

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Conversation Engine** | Custom LangGraph-inspired workflow (not StateGraph API) |
| **LLM** | OpenAI-compatible API — ollama / vLLM / LocalAI / cloud |
| **Messaging** | DingTalk Stream Mode (WebSocket) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM |
| **Web Framework** | Fastify 5.x |
| **Templates** | Nunjucks (admin UI) |
| **Language** | TypeScript (strict mode, ESM) |

### Installation

#### Option A: Quick CLI (recommended for production)

```bash
# Interactive
npx dialog-survey install

# Non-interactive (CI / automation)
npx dialog-survey install \
  --db-url "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dialog_survey" \
  --dingtalk-client-id "xxx" \
  --dingtalk-client-secret "xxx" \
  --dingtalk-agent-id "xxx"
```

This generates `.env`, runs `prisma generate` + `db push`, and sets up PM2 (Linux/macOS) or direct node launch (Windows).

#### Option B: Docker Compose (recommended for evaluation)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your DingTalk + LLM config
docker compose up -d
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

#### Option C: Manual setup (development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/boyingliu01/dialog-survey
cd dialog-survey
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your config
npx prisma generate && npx prisma db push
npm run dev
```

---

### Lifecycle Management

```bash
npx dialog-survey start     # Start service
npx dialog-survey stop      # Stop service
npx dialog-survey status    # Check status
npx dialog-survey uninstall # Remove completely (data preserved)
npx dialog-survey help      # View all commands
```

---

### Configuration

Key environment variables (see `.env.example` for the full list):

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | `postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dialog_survey` |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | LLM endpoint (OpenAI-compatible) | `http://localhost:11434/v1` |
| `LLM_MODEL` | Model name | `qwen2.5` |
| `DINGTALK_CLIENT_ID` | DingTalk Client ID | From DingTalk Open Platform |
| `DINGTALK_CLIENT_SECRET` | DingTalk Client Secret | From DingTalk Open Platform |
| `DINGTALK_AGENT_ID` | DingTalk Agent ID | From DingTalk Open Platform |
| `ADMIN_API_KEY` | Admin panel API key | Your custom key |

> Leave `LLM_API_KEY` empty to use a local LLM at `http://localhost:11434/v1`.

---

### Production Deployment

**Linux / macOS** (PM2):
```bash
npm run build
pm2 start dist/src/server.js --name dialog-survey
pm2 save && pm2 startup
```

**Windows** (direct node):
```bash
npm run build
node dist/src/server.js
```

**Docker**:
```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f app
```

Health check: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`

### Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Hot-reload dev server on :3001
npm run type-check   # TypeScript check (tsc --noEmit)
npm test             # Run tests (Vitest)
npm run lint         # Biome lint
npm run build        # Compile to dist/
npm run smoke        # Quick sanity check (type-check + lint + key tests)
```
